　　今年的“年”，似乎来得有点仓促，有点潦草，小城人大多还没有从阳历新年的闲适与散淡中缓过神来，旧历的“年”，便静悄悄的登堂入室了。
　　串门不端茶杯子端了茶杯子不带暖水瓶就不是轩口窑男人，闲谝不抬杠抬杠不抬得昏天黑地就不是轩口窑男人。轩口窑男人的功夫似乎全在嘴上，或者确切地说张嘴才能更加显出轩口窑男人的本事。可今晚实在是个破天荒的例外。没人吭声，或许他们还没人酝酿出高见，或许是准备先听他们轩口窑的这个外甥的高见的。
　　却不料，朋友们各奔西东，繁忙无序。重返狮山的那个下午，茶馆里虽然也照例闲坐着若干各色人等，但多方徘徊张望，终究没能发现愿意听我诉说的面孔。他们的眼神和心思，都集中在面前的纸牌或麻将桌上；口中念念有词的，只是或大或小、或多或少的得失输赢。
Twilight is the most beautiful praise in the rural south.
The dim moonlight gleaming leisurely and comfortable feeling, is a kind of creep is a misty rain.
Ten years in hexi hedong ten years.
Once upon a time, the home also accompany me to spent twenty years, sunrise, together we look forward to see sunset together;
Tasted the bitter autumn, also together help each other through the long winter.
But now I have not change, the sky has not changed, but you do.
I admire people who ingenuity you decorate into today's appearance, but scary when I stand in the original place after so many years, if we still know each other.
To tell the truth, drunk a human feelings, border party scene, I am still drunk smile of you, the people there, mountains and rivers, there
Admire, thank you for your commitment to entered my life, through all the whole world, I appreciate the time you use the truth leng yan I, with a caring gentle my kung fu, you don't come, I dare not old.
So much deliberately, after passing the time you have I smile a smile, I through the season have you sweet glance.
Earth has a nectar thousands of bottles of pot, and I just miss you for a long time that a cup, I understand, this life, I are here for a long time to my fondness for you in the best you can perceive and to, but my heart for a long time living in your city.
